Therapylog.com is designed to allow you to do all your therapy related planning on this site and using the information about each of your therapy sessions sends the billing information to Medicaid.  This means that instead of keeping your therapy notes (which contains much of the same information that your billing logs would) and a billing log, you can keep your therapy information on Therapylog.com and the billing is done automatically for you.  By selecting \'My Calendar\' you can access the area where you can enter your session planning.

The number of links listed under this heading is shortened to a list that shows only the most recent sessions that have fallen into the past.  As you document they will no longer appear on this list.  When there are no links under the heading, you have completed all your documentation for every session that has already happened.  It may be wise to do your documentation at regular intervals as to not have too many sessions showing in this list.','2010-08-02 21:24:37','2010-08-02 21:24:37'),(4,'What are Generated Report Alerts?','Below this heading you will see that there are links listed below.

You will want to keep students on your caseload until you are certain that all documentation has been completed for any appointment that this student was scheduled for.  Do not worry about adding a student to your caseload that used to be on another therapist\'s list before they remove the student from their list.

You can do this by clicking on the students name in the caseload list.  This will take you to the student\'s profile page.  On this page you can use the calendars to set the current IEP date (the start date of the current IEP) and then the ReEvaluation date (the scheduled date of the upcoming 3 year ReEvaluation).  Therapylog will not bill a session if it appears that the therapy occurred based on an outdated IEP so it is important to keep these dates up to date.  In some cases your administrators will send update files to Therapylog, but it is the therapist\'s responsibility to maintain this information.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(10,'How do I adjust minutes?','If after an IEP meeting it is determined that the number of minutes per week the child is seen should be extended or reduced, you can update this information by selecting \'Edit\' to the right of the student\'s name then adjusting the minutes in the box.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(11,'How do I delete a student?','If you are no longer seeing a student for therapy and all appointments that student attended have been documented you are free to remove that student from your caseload.  You will not loose goal or IEP data entered for that student if you delete them, and the next therapist who adds that student will be able to pull that student information when they add the student.

If you load all your goals in the goals section then you will not have to re-write the goals every time you address them in your documentation.  To add a goal select \'Goals\' to the left of the student\'s name.

If you do not see the student that you wish to add listed among them, continue to type the rest of the student\'s full name.  This will narrow down the search and give you a better chance at finding the student.  If you still cannot find the student you are looking for, contact your administrator with the student\'s name, and student ID so they can add that student to the pool of students you are building your caseload from.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(14,'When do I check \'Consult Only\'','You will check this box only if you are adding a student that does not receive Direct Therapy services but you would still like to record data on this student you work with in a consultative situation.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(15,'How do I add a goal?','At the end of the list of goals there is a link that says \'Add New Goal\'.

If two therapists work with the same student they want to be recording their data for that student so they must work on the same record.  As a result all goals will show up across all therapy disciplines.  Each therapist is only responsible for the goals that they address from the IEP.  Any edits you make to any of the goals will be saved so be sure and only make changes to goals that you address.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(17,'How do I change a goal?','Your goal should read as it does in the IEP so that your documentation reflects that you addressed a goal from the IEP.  If there are spelling errors or other mis-typings, these can be edited by choosing \'Edit\' to the left of the goal.  If you are updating the goals because the IEP has been re-written, it is better to leave the old goal and Inactivate it, and add the newer goals from the most current IEP.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(18,'How do I add a Benchmark?','If a student has benchmarks under a particular goal, you can add these by selecting \'Benchmarks\' to the right of the goal and attach as many benchmarks as you need.   Simply type the Benchmarks into the field on the Benchmark page and submit the form.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(19,'What is an Active goal vs. an Inactive goal?','An Active goal means that this is a goal that you intend to work on with a student for the current IEP.  This means that it is a goal that you will have access to when it comes time to lesson plan for that student.  An Inactive goal will not be accessible to you during the lesson planning stage.  Inactive goals are usually goals that you no longer work with either because they are from a past IEP or they have been met already.  Goals do not become Active or Inactive automatically.  You will have to select \'Inactivate\' in order to Inactivate a goal.  The status of the goal will be shown to the right of the goal.  It\'s important to remember that if you inactivate a goal that does not belong to you the therapist that goal does belong to will not be able to access that goal during the lesson planning stage.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(20,'Why can I delete some goals but not others?','If a goal has already been used in lesson planning it can no longer be deleted because it is needed for the archived documentation for the session in which it was addressed.   Instead if you have used a goal but no longer have need of it, you are welcome to Inactivate this goal.  If there is a link to the right of the goal that says \'Delete\' this goal has not been addressed in a therapy session.  If the goal belongs to you and it will never be addressed in future sessions you are welcome to select the delete link and delete that goal.  This action cannot be undone.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(21,'What should the goal name be?','The goal name should read as it does in the IEP.  You are free to copy the goal out of your IEP system and past it into the Goal Name field to expedite the goal adding process.  If you choose to put a cue at the beginning of a goal for quicker recognition during lesson planning, put that cue at the front of the goal.  If you choose to abbreviate the goal rather then enter it as written in the IEP just keep in mind that the goal when combined with your progress notes comes together to form your complete documentation for a session.  Please direct questions about goal writing to your district administrator.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(22,'What is a GLE?','GLE stands for Grade Level Equivalency.  If you choose to attach a GLE to your goal everywhere your goal is documented the GLE will appear in parenthesis next to the goal.  If your district requires GLEs having the GLE attached to a goal should save you time as you will only ever have to enter it once per IEP cycle.  If your district does not require GLEs you do not have to enter one at all to submit services and your documentation will still show your goals accurately.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(23,'What do I do about diagnosis codes?','Diagnosis codes are the most important part of the goal entering process from a Medicaid perspective.  A session cannot be billed if that session is addressing a goal that does not have an associated diagnosis.  Your district administrators may provide you with a list of diagnosis codes they want you to connect to each goal or may let you choose based on the list of codes in the diagnosis drop down.  Remember when choosing a diagnosis code you are not diagnosing the child but rather categorizing what type of treatment this goal is addressing.  For example if you are an SLP working with an autistic student on articulation a common choice would be 315.39.  Diagnosis codes are left to your professional discretion.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(24,'How do I schedule an Appointment?','Scheduling appointments should be done in advance of the service that you are recording and this task should take the place of your regular lesson planning.  The first step is to select a day you wish to plan for.  The day planner will appear and you can select the hour that you wish to schedule the service.  From there you will be brought to the schedule service page where you can build your therapy groups and do your lesson planning.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(25,'How do I make scheduling more efficient?','There are a couple of features built into the site that will make scheduling and lesson planning faster and easier.  Copy Entire Day:  This feature lets you build your whole day, and then move all the groups and lesson plans for that day into a new day of your choice.  So if you Monday\'s, Wednesday\'s and Friday\'s you have the same schedule, you only have to build that day once.  The button that allows you to copy an entire day is located at the top of the Day Planner.  Copy Appointment: This feature allows you to take a single appointment and copy that over into new days, there by building your day out of appointments that you have already made.  This is particularly effective if none of your days are exactly the same but your groups manage to stay the same.  Warning:  These actions will bring over the lesson plan from the original appointment.  If you wish you can change the lesson plan by editing the session before the session occurs or you can make activity, and goal changes while you are entering your progress notes and documentation.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(26,'What are the drop downs for?','The drop-downs at the top of the month calendar allow you to jump between months and years quickly if you need to move more than one in either direction.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(27,'Why is one day gray?','The day highlighted gray is the current date','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(28,'What does a Green or Purple day mean?','A green day indicates a day that has one or more appointment that has not had its documentation and progress entered.  A purple day indicates that all appointments on that day are completed and can be accessed by your reports.  Its good practice to not go too long with green days but instead to turn them purple as soon as possible.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(29,'How do I print my lesson plan?','To print your whole day\'s lesson plan select the day on the calendar then in the top left hand corner you will see a link that says \'Print Lesson Plans\'.  When you are brought to this link you will be brought to a page that has all of the planning information you entered during your scheduling.  If you are a pen and paper person you may like to keep short hand session notes on these pages before transferring them into Therapylog.com','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(30,'What If I Made a Mistake?','Mistakes happen, and it\'s good if you catch them early on.  After an appointment has been submitted for billing you only have three days before the transactions can no longer be pulled back from Medicaid (its already been billed).  So it\'s important to catch and fix your mistakes early.  If you made a scheduling or Lesson plan error that you would like to correct before the session starts you can click on the green part of the day, click on the appointment then you will be brought to the scheduling page.  You will be brought to the Edit Scheduled Service page where you can change any drop down, add Students, and change lesson plans.If you made a documentation error, as in you have submitted the service for billing and archival, you will need to first unlock the submitted appointment.  You can do this by finding the day of the appointment, then the purple appointment that is incorrect. Inline with the appointment there will be a padlock icon.  If you select this icon you will unlock the appointment.  Unlocking an appointment will pull it back from the group of transactions going to Medicaid, and will turn the appointment from purple to green.  At this point you can either go into the appointment and delete it, or make the necessary changes by editing the appointment.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(31,'What fields are required?','In order for you to create a valid transaction you must choose the school that you are working in, the correct start and stop time, choose a service, and select a student or students.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(32,'How do I build a group?','Adding students to a session to build a group is easy.  Just begin typing a student from your caseload\'s name in the student name field.  Below the box a list of potential students will appear so that you can choose these students.  When you choose a student you will be prompted to lesson plan for this session.  You will select a goal or goals, enter your scheduled activity or activities, and then you can enter the next student in the group.  To add a new student, move your curser to the student field and begin typing the next student\'s name.  Do not hit submit between students.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(33,'Can I have multiple services in a single appointment?','Yes, to choose an additional service you should select from the \'Portion of Appointment\' drop down \'Some\' instead of \'all\' then click on the tab that reads \'Add Another Service\'.   A screen very similar to your first lesson planning screen will show up where you can add student to this portion of appointments.  Remember to enter the amount of time you wish to spend on this part of the appointment.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(34,'How should I word my activities?','If your district has not already established how they would like your activities to be worded, just keep in mind that the activity, along with the IEP goal and your session progress notes together form your official documentation record.  The more detailed you are with your Activity description, the less detailed you will need to be in your progress notes.  If you are still unsure contact your administrator and ask their opinion.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(35,'How do I edit a service?','To edit a service that you have already scheduled make sure that you have unlocked the service appointment that you wish to change (It Should Be Green) then select the day from your calendar, and then the service from your Day Planner.  At this point you will be brought to the Edit Schedule Service page.  It should look a lot like the Scheduling page.  Here you can change any of the drop downs remove or add goals, change times, dates, and add students and services.  Just remember to submit your changes when they are done.','2010-08-02 21:24:38','2010-08-02 21:24:38'),(36,'I can\'t see the goal I am supposed to document on','Instead of listing the goals you worked on for each student on your documentation page, the documentation form provides links to the goals, right next to where you would rate the students\' progress, and enter any data taken.

These notes will appear in your reports so that they can be used in parent teacher conferences, IEP meetings, and can be used by another therapist should the student transfer off of your caseload.  With this in mind your session comments should also describe what you did with the student if it\'s not clear from your activity.
